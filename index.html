        <h2>About Mick Barwood</h2>
        <pI'm sorry to hear about the loss of your beloved dog Scruffy. It's clear that she brought a lot of joy into your life, and it's wonderful that you want to create a website to remember her. I can definitely help you with that.

Here is a sample website that you can use as inspiration. You can personalize it with your own memories, stories, and photos of Scruffy:

Welcome to Scruffy's Tribute Website

In loving memory of Scruffy, our beautiful dog who brought so much joy into our lives. Scruffy was a loyal and loving companion who will always hold a special place in our hearts. She passed away on [insert date], leaving behind a legacy of love and happy memories.

Scruffy was a unique dog with a quirky personality. She loved to play fetch and chase squirrels in the park. She had a fondness for Toblerone chocolate, and we would often catch her sneaking a piece from the pantry. Despite her mischievous nature, she was a gentle and affectionate dog who loved to cuddle.

On this website, we want to share some of our favorite memories of Scruffy with you. We hope that this tribute will serve as a reminder of the love and joy that Scruffy brought into our lives.</p>

        <h2>Our Favourite Memories of Scruffy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One of Scruffy's favorite things to do was to go on car rides. Whenever we would grab our keys, she would get so excited and start jumping up and down. She loved to stick her head out of the window and feel the wind in her fur.</li>

<li>Scruffy was a great listener. Whenever we were feeling down, she would sit by our side and give us a sympathetic look. It was like she knew exactly what we were going through.</li>

<li>We'll never forget the time Scruffy snuck into the kitchen and stole an entire Toblerone bar off the counter. When we found her, she was lying on the floor with chocolate smeared all over her face. Despite the mess, we couldn't help but laugh at her guilty expression.</li>
        
        
       <li> We would like to thank everyone who has supported us during this difficult time. Your kind words and gestures have meant the world to us. We would also like to thank Scruffy for the unconditional love and happiness that she brought into our lives.</li>

Rest in peace, dear Scruffy. You will be forever missed.</ul>
